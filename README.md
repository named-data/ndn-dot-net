NDN-DOT-NET: A Named Data Networking client library for the .NET Framework
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

NDN-DOT-NET is a Named Data Networking client library for the .NET Framework.
Most of the C# code is from an automated translator from jNDN. The distribution
also includes compiled .NET DLL files which should work with C# or other .NET
languages.

NDN-DOT-NET conforms to the NDN Common Client Libraries API and your application
should follow the equivalent Java methods in this public API:
http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-ccl-api/ .

See the file [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-dot-net/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for build and install instructions.

Please submit any bugs or issues to the jNDN issue tracker, mentioning that the
issue is for NDN-DOT-NET. (If we get lots of issues, we may start a separate
Redmine project for it.)
